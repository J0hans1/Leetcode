# My Leetcode repository

This repository contains a set of leetcode solutions.

## Guide

there are some conventions to the structure of this project:

### Folder and file names

as leetcode challenges are numbered, named and can be completed in different languages, each language will have its own folder.
the folder will be named by the convention:
```<number> <short version of challenge name>```
every folder will have contain files with the same name as the language used to solve the challenge:
```<lanuage>.<format>```

an example of what path will look like: ```../Leetcode/Algorithms/1 two sum/python.py```

### Description of the challenge
