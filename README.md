# My Leetcode repository

This repository contains a set of leetcode solutions/attempts at challenges.

## Guide

there are some conventions to the structure of this project:

### Folder and file names

as leetcode challenges are numbered, named and can be completed in different languages, each language will have its own folder.
the folder will be named by the convention:
```<number> <short version of challenge name>```
every folder will have contain files with the same name as the language used to solve the challenge:
```<lanuage>.<format>```

### Completed and uncompleted challenges

some challenges have been completed and will be commented with:
```*SUCCESS```
above the function/method

uncompleted challenges will be commented in a similar manner with:
```!<Status (how close to the solution are you))> <potential fix>```

### Description of the challenge

will be commented as a multiline comment at top of file (if possible)
